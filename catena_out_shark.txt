The smallest shark that ever lived,
so tiny, it was hard to believe.
It had an eye no bigger than a pea,
and its fins were so slim, they looked like a bee.

It scraped the ocean floor for food,
while its tail moved like a rowing rudder.
It swam around with such grace and ease,
so much so that it looked like a gentle breeze.

Its tiny size made it a prime target,
for predators looking for dinner to fillet.
But its size also made it a master of disguise,
and it was able to escape from their eyes.

This smallest of sharks may be small in size,
but it has proven to be quite wise.
It has survived for many years,
and will most likely outlive many peers.
