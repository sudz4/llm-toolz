The smallest shark to ever live
Was a shark so small, it could barely give
A nibble to a snorkeler's toe
For it was barely larger than a crow

It swam the oceans so deep and blue
The littlest shark of all, it's true
But in its smallness it was still a shark
And it caused quite a stir and a spark

It's size was so small, so tiny and slight
But it still managed to give a bite
And even though it was so small and slight
It still managed to give quite a fright

For even though it was small and tiny
It still caused a great deal of worry
To all the creatures of the sea
For this small shark, we'll always see
