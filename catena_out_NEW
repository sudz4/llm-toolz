In 2004, Fred Luddy was working as a senior technology executive for a large software company in San Diego when he was faced with a difficult decision. His company was struggling and he wanted to move on to something different. After much soul-searching, Fred decided to take a risk and start his own company.

He named the company ServiceNow and set out to create a platform for automating business processes. What he created was a cloud-based service that allowed companies to manage their IT departments in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.

The idea was revolutionary and it quickly caught the attention of investors and customers alike. ServiceNow began to grow rapidly and soon became a leader in the industry.

Fred's commitment to innovation and customer service has made ServiceNow a success. Today, ServiceNow is a global leader in cloud-based enterprise service management. It has offices in over 30 countries and serves thousands of customers worldwide.

Fred's gamble to start his own business has paid off. ServiceNow is now a publicly traded company and a trusted source of innovative solutions for businesses around the world.
